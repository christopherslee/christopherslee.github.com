title: Choosing Jekyll over Wordpress
published: false
abstract:
  The first obstacle to blogging is getting started. I've never
  been a fan of wordpress, or any of the other hosted blogging platforms.
  My biggest priorities were simplicity without sacrificing control, ease of
  deployment, syntax-highligting, and speed (performance). After trying out Jekyll, I
  decided it will suit my near-term needs just fine. The only way to really
  validate that decision is to start writing.

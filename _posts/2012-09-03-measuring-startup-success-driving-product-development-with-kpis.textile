h2. Using your KPI goals to guide product development

In the "previous post":http://christopherslee.github.com/2012/08/08/measuring-startup-success-by-defining-key-performance-indicators-kpis.html we discussed the importance of defining key performance indicators for your startup. If you cannot define your success criteria, how can you know if you're heading in the right direction?

Now, I'm going to make the assumption that you are measuring the metrics you have defined. If you can't, stop what you're doing and work on being able to gather the data immediately.

bq(warning). Don't add features just for the sake of adding features (the faux-progress trap).

Going back to our auction site example, we look at our weekly report and see our goal is to have 10,000 users creating 10 listings per month for a $1 listing fee, but we have 10,000 users creating 2 listings per month for a $.50 transaction fee. We immediately see that we've done a good job acquiring customers, but our customers are not listing as many items as we want them to a month, and they're also not spending as much as we would like per transaction.

Based on the data, we focus our product development efforts on increasing the fees generated per listing and the number of listings per user. We hypothesize that add-on services like photo hosting will increase listing transactions fees by another $0.50, and that including in product messaging about minimalism leading to happiness will drive users to declutter their lives by selling off their junk (and hence list more items.)

Alternatively, if you believe acquiring more customers will be easier than increasing listings per user or increasing the average transaction fee, you could change your assumptions. You have to be careful that changing these assumptions doesn't invalidate your business model.

bq(note). Is the total addressable market still big enough to support your new model?

h2. Minimum Viable Product

I'm not saying that you should ignore Minimum Viable Product. On the contrary, if you didn't already have a Minimum Viable Product, I don't think you would be able to see any consistent growth in numbers. If you haven't reached your MVP and you are seeing growth, my first guess would be that you defined your MVP wrong and you've already reached it. Now iterate to success!

h2. Design

I love the work that designers do. But what role does design play in reaching your KPI goals? In certain cases, say conversion rate for example, having a clearer design and call to action can improve numbers. However, simply putting a different visual design on top of the same feature set is a more common, and deadly trap. I've yet to see a successful example of a product with a great visual design and nominal customer value. On the contrary, there are plenty of examples of successful products with below average design, and high customer value (Reddit comes to mind.)

bq(info). Make sure your design work is focused and has a measurable goal.

h2. Conclusion

Your challenge is to figure out what defines success for your startup. Maybe virality is important to you and you need to determine what user actions tend to drive your viral coefficient upwards. Or your business model assumes that you can successfully acquire customers cheaper than your competitor with better SEO. Maybe your goal is your customer's success and word-of-mouth will grow your business (measured by a high Net Promoter Score.)

It could be a combination of many things across different areas. The point is, if you cannot define success for an area of your business, how can you make decisions about where to spend your resources, or know the work you are doing is beneficial at all.

bq(info). Beware of the premature pivot. Just because you've hit a bump in the road doesn't mean you should pivot. Subscribe to get the next post on the premature pivot trap.
